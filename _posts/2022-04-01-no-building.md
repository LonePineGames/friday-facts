Lone Pine:

In playtesting NewCity, we have discovered that much of the game is taken up by mindless tedium building roads and placing amenities. This is extremely boring compared to the fun part of the game, budget management. Therefore we have decided to make a major change: we are removing building mechanics entirely from the game. I'm sure your excited to play this new simplified NewCity. Look for the new patch in early April.
