Lone Pine Games has grown again! Everyone, please give a warm welcome to our new Social Media Manager, Swordless_Mimetown.

But who better to introduce him thanâ€¦ himself? Take it away.

Swordless_Mimetown:

Hello! Happy to be here as part of the NewCity team. I'm going to be getting the word out about the game, as well as answering support questions. I'm a huge fan of any and all games. One of the classics for me is SimCity for the SNES. In my free time, I play all sorts of stuff and write about it from time to time like [Paradise Killer]{:target="_blank"} and [Fall Guys]{:target="_blank"}.

You should expect to hear a bit more from our channels on the road to full release, so stay tuned for some cool stuff. In the meantime, I've got a bus route to plan.

Hello NewCitizens. This week we've made the initial release of the Oceanic update. With it, we've got quite a few new designs, but most of all, decorations. Tons of them. Some colorful, others only shades with no saturation. Some small, others a freaking Container Ship. Yeah, quite a few new additions from a few weeks of work have been added and there's more to come.

Other than the water related buildings that were implemented, we also have now a palette that is not a single file anymore, but 98. That means one illumination and one albedo image for each of the twelves frames of animation. For each season. Trust me, it's less scary than it sounds.

I could go on about the animated palette or the new designs such as the beaches and the piers but you can read about all of that in the [Steam guide]{:target="_blank"} (and if you can't you're free to annoy me until I add that there).

One other little thing I'm releasing today is a mini mod called the halloween mod. It's pretty simple and silly but hey, it's spooky. And it shows how easily you can mod the game. Shout out to Supersoup for making some cool decorations for that!

That's it for me this week and please tell me if you're seeing any weirdness on my designs. Unless it's a pumpkin, then it's supposed to be there.

Lone Pine did an incredible job with the terrain fade and ambient fog effects. Believe it or not, they don't just look incredible -- they're also contributing to our performance goals. Being able to fade out distant terrain with a convincing effect helps to cull unnecessary details and keep your framerate humming along. 

With Swordless_Mimetown aboard, our development team has grown to four active members. Granted he'll be focusing on Social Media Management, but with his unique skillset and extensive experience, he'll be taking our digital presence to the next level while also freeing up Lone Pine and I to focus on what we do best: making games. 

Rarely do programmers and extroversion coincide.

I'll be handing off the Steam Workshop to Lone Pine for the final stretch until release. We have the full Upload->Subscribe->Download loop working, so now it's just a matter of integrating those files with the other game content in a meaningful way. Essentially adding another layer on top of the base game, much like the mod layer. That was Lone Pine's doing way back when, so he'll be best equipped to take this project across the finish line.

As for me? There are some new and exciting milestones on the horizon. We've started turning the waterfronts of your city into meaningful space for your citizens, and the airspace above has yet to be conquered. The modding platform is bigger and better than before, and once the Steam Workshop is finally and fully online, we're excited to see all of your content moving NewCity in directions we couldn't have anticipated.

There's also improvements to the economic simulation to consider. Not to mention tourism, so you might capitalize on all that prime lakeside real estate with a bit of extra revenue. That should bring us into the midst of Q1 2021. 

After that, the sky's the limit.
