Swordless Mimetown:

The NewCity logo has been in flux almost since the beginning. Back in the Before Timesâ„¢ of January 2020 the game was called New Cities. The evolution to NewCity, and from there to our recently released Steam page redesign, has not been as much of a trajectory, and more like a series of hops/skips/jumps.

Comparably, the name Lone Pine Games is great from a branding perspective. Put a single tree around some text and take an early lunch. But video games have a naming problem; you want to let players know what genre the game is while also showing off what makes it unique. City simulation games will almost always contain some kind of variant on those two aforementioned words. We went with 'City'.

The transition from New Cities to NewCity was vital to our marketing operations. Search Engine Optimization, or SEO, can make or break a brand. Nobody went out of businesses being the first result on Google. And while NewCity is still a fairly competitive term (there seem to be dozens of NewCity businesses), we have the strongest presence for our market.

When I joined the team at the tail end of 2020 there was some catch-up to do. Like a lot of great passion projects, the game had grown into a phenomenal piece of media without the restrictions of corporate bureaucracy. But as Warhol said, making money is art. And when a game as great as NewCity needs more exposure, you gotta get creative.

That is to say, a slight text change and a green gradient aren't exactly the pinnacle of creativity. But we're not done yet! There's a lot more where all this came from.
