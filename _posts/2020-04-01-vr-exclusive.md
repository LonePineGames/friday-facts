When I first started seeing videos of Half Life: Alyx, I knew we had to reproduce that experience for NewCity. While I haven’t played a serious VR game yet, I already know that it is the future of the industry. NewCity without the VR aspect would clearly be a lesser game, and therefore we have teamed up with Microsoft to make NewCity a VR exclusive game.

That’s right: starting next week, we will begin testing a build of the game specially designed for Windows Mixed Reality. This means not just VR but also AR support. You’ll be able to build your virtual city while simultaneously exploring your actual city in a new way. This is an unprecedented experience and we are so proud to be able to bring it to you.

Our plan is to quickly phase out the flat version of NewCity in favor of VR, so as to not overburden our limited resources. Yes, this means that the HoloLens will become a requirement. Apologies to backers who may be inconvenienced by the change, but technological innovation is rarely convenient, and we’re confident that the end result will mean better cities for all.

Obviously, this also means the end of Linux support, but nobody really cared anyway.
