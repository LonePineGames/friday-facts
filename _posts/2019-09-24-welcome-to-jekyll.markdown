Hi, Lone Pine here. I'm going to start posting weekly updates on the project to keep you guys informed of what's going on, what features are being worked on, and our progress on the road to release.

If your new here, I'm working on a citybuilder called New Cities.  In the past few months I've fully implemented "The Prosperity System" which will define the game. It's an dynamic economic model where neighborhoods thrive or fail based on access to work, shopping, parks, and schools.

We'll be starting crowdfunding in the next two months. One of the tier rewards will be to participate in a closed alpha, which we hope to start before the end of the year.

If you're excited to play the game, join the [discord] or [subreddit].
