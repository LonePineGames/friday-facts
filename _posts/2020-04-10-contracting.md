How’s it going, mayors. This week supersoup and Lone Pine are tag-teaming the Friday Facts.
There’s lots going on behind the scenes in this exciting new season. Let’s take a look at just a few of the work items:

## Transit Update

Lone Pine: NewCity is a great traffic simulation. I am working on turning it into a great *transportation* simulation. People (and freight) travel in many, many different ways, and we want to capture all that beautiful complexity in the game. 

In my research on public transportation I’ve discovered that there are a great many ideas for how to move people in a city, more than could ever be represented in a game, but we can certainly do a lot better than the standard “bus/tram/metro” combo. This week I prototyped a mechanic where you, the city planner, actually design an original transit system for your city. You’ll then call for engineering firms to design your dream system, and choose among multiple bids. You’ll have to weigh options, costs, and risks.

There’s still a lot to do, so it will be some weeks before this system rolls out. Expect lots of changes as the game grows into its full potential. It will be a “SuperRide”, I promise!

# New Hire

Supersoup: Lone Pine Games is growing! Thanks to your support via IndieGoGo, we were able to bring aboard an artist. Expect to see much more love and attention given to the art side of NewCity in the coming months. And perhaps a new team member introduction post.

Last week was the first of what I hope to be many Lone Pine stream nights. We played NewCity, started Ahoy City, Anaheim, built residential divisions while listening to dubstep, and talked about VR among many other things. It was great interacting with those of you that watched the stream, and for those that didn’t, I hope you’ll consider joining us next time. But who knows when the next time will be. Could be sooner than you think...

Oh look, there it is. The next time will be tonight: Friday, April 10th, at 10pm PDT/Mtn. We (Lone Pine and supersoup) are going to play Factorio! I (supersoup) have never played, but Lone Pine has—and apparently there’s co-op? Come join, watch me learn a thing or two about automation on alien worlds. We’ll be broadcasting the festivities over on the official [Lone Pine Games Twitch]!
