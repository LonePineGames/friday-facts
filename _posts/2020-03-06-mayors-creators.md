Hey folks, it’s supersoup again! This week we’d like to shine the spotlight on the Mayors & Creators in our community. It never gets old seeing the cities you sculpt from the formless clay, and it especially warms my heart to see the custom textures and buildings you’re importing. As we draw nearer to Early Access the modding support will only continue to grow. I’m as eager as an Amazon delivery driver to see what new and innovative things you build! 

We’ll get to some fun highlights in a moment. But now it’s time for a word from Lone Pine on Mass Transit.

Over the weekend, we will release version 51. Version 51 will introduce buses (for real this time). You will be able to place bus lines, set headways, set prices, and watch it go. Future transit options will be faster than buses, but logically a bus trip can never be faster than a car trip taking the same roads. Therefore, commuters will estimate the cost of fuel to drive to their destination and compare that to how much they value their time. If the money saved is worth it, they’ll go by bus.

This version is very rough. The graphics are preliminary and you will certainly encounter some bugs. However, I have completed the most difficult part of mass transit, and we are over the hump. I’m so excited to implement the planned design-your-own-transit-system framework when I get back from vacation. For now, we want to get this out to you so you can test it and give us feedback. I think you will enjoy it!

One of the beautiful aspects of game development is the satisfaction of building tools to facilitate creativity. It starts with tools suited to making development faster and easier, but inevitably, those tools gain a second life if (and in our case, when) they’re released to the community. Then they become part of a broader modding suite that supports the creativity of others. 

In the immortal words of Bob Ross, “You can do anything you want. This is your world.” And on the canvas of New Cities, you have the opportunity to create something New. Let’s take a look at some of your paintings thus far.

It's great to see folks diverisfying their cities with the Building Designer. We know the initial rollout has been shaky, but we're already seeing screenshots of custom buildings out in the wild, and we're so happy you're finding value in the tool. Sometimes literally when you boost the building's land value effect.

In a world of endless possibility, some just want to rule with an iron fist. More power to you! Just try not to be *too* evil.

There's something magical about cities at dusk and dawn. The twilight hours, where the windows glitter with the rose and gold rays of the sleeping sun, while homes and even skyscrapers glow with the cheery light of habitation.

Even the simple arrangements of roads and zones can be beautiful. Like decluttering a desk.

I could wax poetic again, but I think we all know how I (supersoup) feel about these sorts of screenshots at this point. It's sunset. The world falls asleep while dreamers wake to greet the night.
