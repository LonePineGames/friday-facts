Dear friends,

The day has finally arrived! [The New Cities IndieGoGo campaign is live!](https://igg.me/at/new-cities)
For those of you ready to stick a chip in the dip that is New Cities, now’s your chance. The IndieGoGo campaign will run through the end of the year, and every dollar will go toward helping New Cities emerge from the development cocoon as a beautiful butterfly. Or a moth. Some sort of winged creature, at least.

The point is, it’s time for our little city builder to spread its wings and fly.
We’ve got a few perks for you if you support New Cities during the campaign. Check out the details below:

You’re probably as eager to play New Cities as we are to have you play it, so the first 250 contributors (Apartment Complex tier and up) will receive access to the Closed Alpha. It begins in January and runs right up to the Early Access release. Put down some roads, build up a few cities, and you’ll have our undivided attention for feedback as we tune and polish.

The House tier comes with the opportunity to put your **name in the credits** right beside the developers, as a special thanks for your support, along with access to an **exclusive channel and role on our Discord.** You’ll have the ear of the development team; use this newfound power wisely. And, **random citizens** of cities will be **named after you**, with your permission of course!

The next tier, Apartment Complex, nets you a **New Cities Game Key** on final release, and the opportunity to **vote in a New Feature poll** to shape the next leg of our journey. But like any good mayor, perhaps you want to keep building onward and upward from there.

With the Factory tier, you become the proud owner of a **New Cities T-Shirt**, along with **additional votes in New Feature polls** to ensure your voice is heard. You’ll get a chance to shape the future of the game—we need your feedback to make it the best it can be! As a special thanks, **schools, parks and roads will be named in your honor**.

The Office Complex tier is more of a good thing, Your voting power is upped to **ten votes in the New Feature polls**, so you can rest comfortably in the knowledge that the future of New Cities is being shaped by dapper and wise patrons such as yourself. You’ll also be **immortalized in-game with a statue**, handcrafted by the developers with your input.

The final tier, Skyscraper, is for the true city builder fanatic. You’ll get an opportunity to have a **30 minute conversation with the developer** to discuss features and gameplay and to suggest new content. In addition to all of the above, you get a massive **one hundred votes in the New Feature polls**, and **top-tier naming in the credits**. Oh, and you’ll get your very own **3D printed skyscraper**.

Should you choose to support us at any level, you will have our undying gratitude. And a bundle of perks that we hope will bring a smile to your face. The beauty of the indie gamedev community is how we all come together, developers and players, to create the experiences we wish to see. So thank you for joining us on this journey. We wouldn’t want any other community by our side.

Whew. It’s been a lot of work to get here. Now that IndieGoGo is… well, going… it’s time to get back to work on New Cities. We can’t wait to read your stories and see what you build. The Closed Alpha is just around the corner, with Early Access hot on its heels. The future is bright, and your cities will shine brighter.

Dream big and build bigger,
Mitch (supersoup)
