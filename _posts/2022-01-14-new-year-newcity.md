... \**tap*\* \**tap*\* Is this thing on? Hello? 

Oh, hi! It's good to see you again. Took me a while to squeeze around the elephant in the room. But we're back! 

I'm supersoup. You may remember me from such films as "Community Management: A Gateway to the Games Industry" and "Sidestepping into Development: A Tale of Two Skillsets." I'm still developing, but now I'm doing this community management thing again too! 

Let's talk about NewCity, shall we?

We had a deadline set for ourselves way back during the IndieGoGo campaign: version 1.0 by the end of 2021. We didn't make it. Yet the game lives on. We simply underestimated the project, as newly fledged indie devs are wont to do. Like Galahad reminded me, an old saying goes "Ask a programmer to estimate the time for a project, then multiply that by three." 

Fortunately you won't have to do that. The road from here to NewCity version 1.0 is measured in months, not years. But there's still a bit of dusty trail ahead of us. So we're all set here after the holidays to get to moseying. 

First in the queue is the long awaited Art Update. Lone Pine and Gainos have been hard at work laying the foundation to take NewCity to the next level visually. This includes things like billboarding terrain trees (improved performance!), new decos and designs, and much more besides. Oh, and we're taking care of that pesky black building bug. Thanks to everyone in our Discord for the reports on that!

But as you and I both well know, there's a lot left to be done before we can put a bow on v1.0. We have an internal list of outstanding issues, comments, and feature requests which was the topic of a meeting just today, in fact. Allow me to list a few of the highlights here:

- Art Update (but I repeat myself)
- Steam Workshop Overhaul, including improving/finishing the upload/update loop for Workshop items
- More individual bug reports than you can shake a stick at
- Mass Transit review/bug pass/feature pass
- Soundtrack v2.0 (by yours truly!) 
- Modding API finalization/documentation
- And much more!

That's just a brief overview. Rest assured, the list is comprehensive and set to grow as we go. Don't fret if you don't see something specific. We're likely aware of it and considering solutions. But it never hurts to reach out to us and confirm that. 

The road goes ever on and on. And development on NewCity is primed to proceed apace in the new year. Apologies for the bout of silence and for missing the 2021 deadline for v1.0. We think the game will benefit from the extra time â€“ and once we're at the finish line, we hope you will agree.

Since I'm back doing this community management thing again, please feel free to ping me (@supersoup) over on [Discord]{:target="_blank"} with your questions, comments, or concerns. I look forward to hearing from you!

With sincere well wishes to you and yours for a splendid 2022,
