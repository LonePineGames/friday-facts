supersoup:

The NewCity Summer Spectacular came to a close this past Tuesday, July 13th. But the spectacular summer days roll on!  

We had a lot of awesome submissions covering everything from scenic skylines to aesthetic building designs. It's been so enriching to see what you've dreamed up, dear NewCity community, and please understand we hold each entry in the NewCity Summer Spectacular near and dear to our hearts here at Lone Pine Games. It was incredibly tough to narrow down the entries to a select few. In the end, though, we've got to pick a few winners.

So away we go!

There's some beautiful cities and incredible designs in the honorable mentions. Like we said, it was incredibly tough to narrow it down. But narrow it down we did. We were looking for the content that we felt best exemplified the Summertime Spectacular motif. Among the Top 5 entries, you'll find high quality work that pushes the Building Designer to its limits as well as majestic, towering, and tourist-friendly cityscapes.

Our Top 5 Summer Spectacular Entries, as determined by a combination of community and team votes: 

{% include image.html class="caption-bottom"

  description="5. DoctoLad"
%}

DoctoLad put together a lovely hotel you might find on the bayou or in the old town of any vacation destination. What it lacks in bright, shiny metal or glass, it makes up in old-fashioned charm and likely a haunted hotel room or two. That's why he squeezed in at number 5 on our top 5 list — congratulations DoctoLad!

%}

In keeping with the hotel theme, Precious Darling Boy put together a monolithic hotel that's certain to grab your attention no matter where you're at in the city. With beams of light advertising rooms with secluded balconies from which you can admire the scenery, this isn't likely to be the cheapest hotel on the block, but it's bound to be the best. Congrats on earning the number 4 spot, Precious Darling Boy!

{% include image.html class="caption-bottom"

  description="3. T-A-R"
%}

Summer often means time spent at the waterfront. So T-A-R put together a city with a splendid little marina beside a cruise shop dock, with the seasonal rentals rolling away beyond. The perfect place to get away from it all and spend some time beneath sail and sun on the water. Congratulations T-A-R, you snagged the number 3 spot! 

{% include image.html class="caption-bottom"
  url="/assets/images/83/83_sargo01_02.jpg"
  description="2. Sargo"
%}

This building design made everyone on the team stop and gawk for a moment. This monstrous tower of steel and glass looks like it belongs in Dubai, and the skybridge is an excellent touch to an overall incredible piece of design work. Well done, Sargo — you reached number 2 with aplomb!

Some cities have it all. Beautiful beaches, an electric amusement park on a pier, and even a well timed sailboat in the bay beneath a clean skyline. There's even a Central Park-esque preserve of trees and green in the midst of all those polished skyscrapers. It's frankly a breathtaking screenshot — and that's what earned Precious Darling Boy his second Top 5 entry and the number 1 entry overall. As an aside, this entry earned the coveted "Lone Pine's Favorite" award. What exactly that means remains to be seen. 

For those of you who placed in the Top 5, we'll be reaching out with details on your prizes by the end of the month. But I simply can't thank you all enough. Thank you to each and every community member who submitted their designs, cities, and shared this Summer Spectacular with us. We're already looking forward to the next seasonal event, so be sure to keep an eye out for more Spectaculars to come!
