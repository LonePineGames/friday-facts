Gainos:

Very short update here. This week is the first time I’ve gone into the NewCity steam workshop and I took a look at some designs uploaded by community members there. I’ve done quite a few designs (that means a lot) that are included in the game and seeing fans creating their own is really heartwarming. I’ve seen player decisions for issues that I’ve had before and each player tackles those differently.

It’s only a matter of time before more players that uploaded their designs and modpacks on the discord page start flooding the workshop with their creations - and that’s exactly what we want to see. So yeah, I’m looking at you modders, I am personally really excited to see your content being uploaded to the workshop.

 If any of you have seen the small halloween mod I myself and Supersoup have created, you’ve seen that such a thing can really change the feel of the game - and that modpack doesn’t even scratch the surface of what you can do with the game’s modding system.
Anyway, see you guys next week and keep creating!

Swordless:

I'm just about done with my first full week here with Lone Pine Games and it's been amazing. I've been impressed by the community response to what we've done so far and I'm excited to say that we have a lot more planned!

This week my work has mostly been recon, analytics diving, as well as catching up with social media and advertising. NewCity is an amazing game, especially for being incomplete, and getting the word out about what we have is, well, much easier thanks to that.

Marketing is a strange thing in the games industry compared to other media. It's creative work with a lot of metrics and goals and measurable results, which as a writer is somewhat comforting. Sometimes you don't need marketing, and sometimes it doesn't even work. But I personally believe every game has potential to make an impact, if the right people learn about it. Getting that audience into our community is what I'm gonna do.
