 I don’t know if you’ve checked out the Vaporwave modpack recently, but it’s shaping up to be something really stunning. And I can say that because I haven’t had much hand in it except for some backend code, SFX, and the song "Logging In" that went out with the patch last night. Hopefully my contributions meet the high bar set by with the incredible work Gainos and Lone Pine have been doing over there.

The thing about the Vaporwave modpack is that it’s really more of a testbed for us. In order to properly develop our modding tools, it stands to reason we should be putting a modpack together ourselves, right? It’s been an enlightening experience, revealing rough edges we hadn’t noticed before and new opportunities to improve the pipeline for all the modders out there. And the end result is something that has piqued my interest as a broadly traveled gamer myself. 

Basically we took our humble citybuilder and pushed it into the retro-future as defined by 1980s sci-fi. It’s not a vision of the clean and shiny Star Trek future. It’s one where pollution hangs thick in the air, buildings radiate neon light into the overcast night, and Reprogramming Towers enforce law and order through radio waves beamed from a comically large and ominous satellite dish. You know, typical B-movie fare.

In the process of executing on this vision, we pushed our modding platform to its limits. We introduced replacements for a wide variety of vehicles in the game, swapping sleek hovercars for the sedans and minivans. Gainos overhauled our visuals to teem with neon colors and unique texture work. Lone Pine changed many of the fundamental game rules and transformed the game into something remarkably novel. 

To highlight one example, building underground is significantly cheaper now to reflect the population’s move beneath the rugged blanket of the Earth in order to escape the toxic clouds above. And all this accomplished with the Lua API and other tools available to modders right this very moment.

We also changed UI sound effects and added music. Implementing more music meant making the caching and playback of music aware of the difference between vanilla and mod music. So there’s a few backend changes to smooth out rough edges, but by and large the Vaporwave modpack is a product of the tools we’ve extended to you, the community. 

I sincerely hope it sparks a fire in your imagination and gets you dreaming about your own unique spin on the citybuilder foundation. Our modding platform will be standing by for you to work your magic.
