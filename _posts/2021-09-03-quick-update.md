Just a quick update today. We've been focusing on bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as getting the new tutorial out. The biggest small change in the upcoming version will be a new layout for the toolbar. We're adding labels to all the tools to make them easier to navigate. Expect the next patch within a couple weeks. Thanks for your patience!
