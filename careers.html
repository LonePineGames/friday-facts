  <p><strong>[PAID] Lone Pine Games is looking for a 2D/UX Artist (Contract, Remote)</strong></p>
  <p>
    Lone Pine Games is looking to hire a Contract 2D/UX Artist for NewCity!
  </p>

  <p>
    NewCity is a city simulation game that's been on Steam in Early Access for over six months. After a successful Indiegogo campaign in 2019, our game has come a long way. Our success has allowed us to bring on a contract-based 2D/UX artist to help overhaul our in-game icons.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are looking for someone to re-create and re-design our UI, specifically the icons. They will take the palette created by our Art Director and adapt it into our UI design. You are welcome to change or adapt the icon art style. You will be provided with a copy of the game, a full list of all icons, and descriptions of what they should depict, as well as compensation of $500+ USD (based on experience). Turnaround time is one month maximum with a two-week target.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ideal candidate would have:
  </p>

  <li>
    Proven experience working in a similar capacity for a game, product, or brand
  </li>

  <li>
    Experience with branding/graphic design
  </li>

  <li>
    Examples of video game UX design in your portfolio
  </li>

  <li>
    Proven reliability for remote work, self-discipline, and time management
  </li>

  <li>
    Familiarity with the city-builder/simulation genre (SimCity, Cities: Skylines, Factorio)
  </li>

  <p>
    Nice to have, but not required:
  </p>

  <li>
    Experience with Aseprite
  </li>

  <li>
    At least one shipped commercial video game
  </li>

  <li>
    Able to join us for stand-up meetings when available
  </li>

  <p>
    Please email us or message us on Discord (Swordless Mimetown#3333) with your resume and links to portfolios. I'll be happy to answer any questions!
